# Next Steps
Are there important TODO items not yet captured? No.
Evaluation: No. This iteration added benchmark run completion accounting (`total_runs_expected` and `total_runs_completed`) to `run-metadata.txt`; remaining meaningful work is still to execute the benchmark rerun and publish updated deltas.

- [ ] Rerun `scripts/benchmark_profile.sh` with the default `MIXES` (including `32:1`) and verify timeout-protected runs complete or fail fast with actionable errors from the new timeout probe/reporting path.
- [ ] Publish updated full default-profile baseline vs candidate benchmark deltas after the rerun, including `run-metadata.txt` context with expected/completed run counts.
